      <!-- Below it's demonstrated two ways of associating labels to inputs:
      First is by associating explicitly with the 'for' attribute. The 'for' attribute
      must be the same than the input 'id' attribute -->
      <label for="billing-address">Same as billing address</label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="billing-address">

      <br>
      <!-- Second, is associated by nesting, the input is now implicitly related to its label so
      in theory, a 'for' attribute should not be needed. However, for ensuring screen reader support,
      its recommended to use the 'for' attribute in conjunction with input 'id' -->
      <label for="telephone">Telephone Number
        <input type="tel" id="telephone">
      </label>
      <!-- Below is applied an autocomplete attribute for the email input: -->
      <label for="email">
        <span>Email:</span>
        <input type="email" id="email" placeholder="example@udacity.com" autocomplete="email">
      </label>
